The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic two-player strategy game where players take turns marking 'X' or 'O' in a 3×3 grid. The objective is to get three marks in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before the opponent does. If all nine cells are filled and no player achieves this, the game results in a draw.

This project is built using PHP for backend processing, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend to provide an interactive and engaging user experience.

Project Features:

✅ Win Detection: The game checks for a winner after every move based on predefined winning conditions.
✅ Draw Detection: If all cells are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.
✅ Session Management: The game state is maintained using PHP sessions, allowing smooth gameplay without refreshing.
✅ Restart Option: A "Play Again" button resets the board to start a new game.
✅ Responsive Design: The game works well on different screen sizes, including mobile devices.
